# TabSphere

**TabSphere** is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by organizing and displaying your open tabs in a visually appealing and efficient manner. With features like search, category filtering, timeline view, alphabetical sorting, and easy tab management, TabSphere ensures that users can manage their tabs effectively and intuitively.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tab Display:** Visualize your open tabs in a spherical layout, making it easy to locate them in an intuitive interface.
  
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific tabs by typing into the search bar. The live search filters results in real-time as you type.

- **Category Organization:** Tabs are automatically categorized into groups like productivity, development, entertainment, social, and more. This allows you to quickly filter tabs based on their content.

- **Timeline View:** Organize your tabs based on their last access time, helping you track recently used tabs. The timeline divides tabs into timeframes like *Just Now*, *Last Hour*, *Today*, and *Yesterday*.

- **Sort Tabs Alphabetically:** Easily sort your tabs in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order, making navigation more efficient.

- **Remove Tabs:** Directly close tabs you no longer need from within the extension. A convenient "X" button appears next to each tab, allowing for quick tab removal without leaving the interface.

- **Customizable View Modes:** Switch between three distinct views:
  - **Sphere View:** A unique spherical visualization of your tabs.
  - **Category View:** Organize and group tabs by categories.
  - **Timeline View:** See tabs arranged by when they were last accessed.
